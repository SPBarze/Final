          <h2>The backrooms are a series of collaborative Urban Legends
        that are based on the idea of slipping outside of reality by “noclipping” into the supposed Backrooms. The original “backroom” is a infinite loop of office rooms, filled with the rank smell of wet carpet and yellow discolored walls. It is said once one enters the backroom(s), it is almost impossible to leave.

        Humans themselves cannot comprehend how the backrooms manipulate space because the backrooms themselves exist outside of it. </h2>

            <h2>
              Although the backrooms are said to mostly be old rank office buildings, a lot of the time (depending on what system you are looking into) they look very different. Whether it is dark pipeline systems, pools, maybe even arcades or playgrounds, the backrooms can almost be anything because, afterall, they are infinite. No one really knows how many there are (although it is thought they stop at level 9223372036854775807, but this may only be the last level comprehendible by humans.)
